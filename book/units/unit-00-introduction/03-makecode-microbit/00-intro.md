# Introduction to MakeCode for micro:bit

In addition to game development, MakeCode is also a powerful tool for programming the BBC micro:bit, a small, programmable device designed to teach students about coding and electronics. MakeCode allows users to easily create and upload programs to the micro:bit, using either block-based coding for beginners or text-based languages like JavaScript and Python for more advanced users. By combining MakeCode with the micro:bit, students can explore interactive projects, build simple electronics, and even control sensors and other hardware components.

## What is the BBC micro:bit?

The BBC micro:bit is a pocket-sized computer designed to help beginners learn programming and electronics. It features an LED matrix display, buttons, sensors, and wireless communication capabilities, making it versatile for a wide range of projects. With the ability to run programs created in environments like MakeCode, the micro:bit allows students to create interactive applications, such as games, temperature monitors, or wearable technology, all while learning important coding and problem-solving skills.
