# Programming Languages

In this section, we will explore what programming languages are and how they help computers understand and execute instructions. Just like humans communicate using spoken languages, computers use programming languages to interpret the instructions given to them by programmers. Understanding the basics of programming languages is key to creating algorithms that a computer can follow.

## What is a Programming Language?

A **programming language** is a system of communication used to give instructions to a computer. It allows programmers to write code that tells the computer what tasks to perform, such as calculations, data processing, or running applications. Programming languages use specific syntax and rules to structure these instructions, making them understandable by both humans and machines. There are different types of programming languages, such as block-based, text-based, and scripting languages, each designed for different purposes and levels of complexity.
