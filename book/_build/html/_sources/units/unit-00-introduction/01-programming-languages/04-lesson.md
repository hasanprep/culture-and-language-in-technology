# Lesson: 

## Types of Programming Languages

There are several types of programming languages. Each type has different functionality to perform specific tasks. Here are some of the types of programming languages:

1. **Block-based programming languages:**
These use visual blocks that snap together to create programs, making them ideal for beginners. Users can build code by dragging and dropping blocks instead of typing.
- <u>MakeCode</u>: Used for creating games and coding microcontrollers with a block-based interface.
- <u>Scratch</u>: A popular tool for teaching coding to beginners.
2. **Text-based programming languages:**
These require you to write code using specific syntax and rules.
- <u>Python</u>: Easy to read and widely used for web development, data analysis, and automation.
- <u>JavaScript</u>: Commonly used for building interactive websites.
- <u>Java</u>: Used for mobile apps and software development.
- <u>C++</u>: Used in game development and applications needing high performance.
3. **Markup languages:**
Used to define the structure and layout of content, often for websites.
- <u>HTML</u>: Defines the structure of web pages.
- <u>XML</u>: Used to store and transport data.
4. **Scripting languages:**
These automate tasks within software applications.
- <u>Bash</u>: Used in Unix/Linux environments for task automation.
- <u>Perl</u>: Known for text processing and system management.
5. **Compiled languages:**
These are converted into machine code by a compiler before running.
- <u>C</u>: A foundational language used in system programming.
- <u>Go</u>: Known for its simplicity and efficiency in building large-scale software.

In this course, we will use MakeCode, a block-based programming language that allows you to build programs by dragging and dropping blocks, which makes it easier to visualize and understand how code works. MakeCode is especially helpful for beginners because it provides a fun and accessible way to start coding without needing to learn complex syntax right away.
