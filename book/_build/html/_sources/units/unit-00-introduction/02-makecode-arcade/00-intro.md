# Introduction to MakeCode Arcade

In this section we will learn about the MakeCode Arcade Development Environment. MakeCode Arcade is an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** designed to help you create your own games using a block-based or text-based programming language. It provides an easy and fun way for beginners to learn how to code by allowing you to drag and drop blocks of code to build your game. If youâ€™re ready for more advanced coding, you can switch to JavaScript or Python within the same environment.

## What is an Integrated Develompment Environment?

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software tool that combines all the resources needed to write, test, and debug code in one place. It typically includes a code editor, a compiler or interpreter, and a debugger, making it easier for programmers to develop software without switching between multiple tools. IDEs help streamline the coding process by providing useful features like syntax highlighting, error checking, and a visual interface for running and testing programs, all within a single platform.

## What is MakeCode Arcade?

MakeCode Arcade is a free, beginner-friendly platform developed by Microsoft that allows users to create 2D video games using block-based or text-based coding. Designed to teach programming in a fun and interactive way, it is particularly popular among students and educators. The platform includes a built-in image editor for creating custom game art, as well as a coding environment that supports both block-based programming for beginners and JavaScript or Python for more advanced users. MakeCode Arcade can be used on a variety of devices, from computers to handheld gaming consoles, making it a versatile tool for learning computer science and game development.
