# Lab: Plotting a Ha:ṣañ with MakeCode Arcade

## Introduction

TODO

```{note}
This lab contains a complete example for reference only. Do not use this as your submission. Each ha:ṣañ should be unique.
```

## Objectives

<blockquote>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
    <br>
    <li>Understand how the coordinate system in MakeCode Arcade relates to the Cartesian plane.</li>
    <li>Create and plot simple line segments by defining pairs of coordinate points in MakeCode Arcade.</li>
    <li>Use MakeCode Arcade’s tools to visualize and test the plotted line segments in a game or interactive project.</li>
    <br>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

## Materials

<blockquote>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
    <br>
    <li>1 PC or laptop</li>
    <li>1 ELECFREAKS Retro Arcade</li>
    <li>1 USB-C cable</li>
    <l1>1 MakeCode Arcade Screen Grid</li>
    <l1>1 Sheet of paper to write the algorithm</li>
    <l1>1 Pencil</li>
    <br>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

## Procedure

### 1. Gather All Materials

TODO

### 2. Plan Your  Plot of a Ha:ṣañ

```{important}
The following example illustrates the process. **You must plan your own ha:ṣañ**.

### 3. Write Your Ha:ṣañ Plot Algorithm

```{important}
The following example illustrates the process. **You must write your own algorithm**.
```

1. Draw line from (85, 25) to (75, 25)
2. Draw line from (75, 25) to (75, 50)
3. Draw line from (75, 50) to (65, 50)
4. Draw line from (65, 50) to (65, 40)
5. Draw line from (65, 40) to (55, 40)
6. Draw line from (55, 40) to (55, 60)
7. Draw line from (55, 60) to (75, 60)
8. Draw line from (75, 60) to (75, 90)
9. Draw line from (75, 90) to (85, 90)
10. Draw line from (85, 90) to (85, 70)
11. Draw line from (85, 70) to (105, 70)
12. Draw line from (105, 70) to (105, 50)
13. Draw line from (105, 50) to (95, 50)
14. Draw line from (95, 50) to (95, 60)
15. Draw line from (95, 60) to (85, 80)
16. Draw line from (85, 60) to (85, 25)

### 4. Write the Code for Your Ha:ṣañ Plot

```{important}
The following example is just an example to illustrate the process. **You must write your own code**.
