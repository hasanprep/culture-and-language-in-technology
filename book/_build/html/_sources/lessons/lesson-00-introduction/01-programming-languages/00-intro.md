# Programming Languages

In this section, we will explore what programming languages are and how they help computers understand and execute instructions. Just like humans communicate using spoken languages, computers use programming languages to interpret the instructions given to them by programmers. Understanding the basics of programming languages is key to creating algorithms that a computer can follow.

## What is a programming language?

A **programming language** is a system of communication that allows people to write instructions for computers to follow. These instructions tell the computer how to perform specific tasks, from simple calculations to running complex programs. There are many different programming languages, each designed for different purposes. Some of the most common programming languages include:

- Python: Known for its simplicity and readability, often used for web development, automation, and data analysis.
- JavaScript: Primarily used for creating interactive websites and web applications.
- Java: A versatile language often used in mobile applications, especially for Android.
- C++: Used for system software, game development, and applications that require high-performance computing.

In this course, we will use MakeCode, a block-based programming language that allows you to build programs by dragging and dropping blocks, which makes it easier to visualize and understand how code works. MakeCode is especially helpful for beginners because it provides a fun and accessible way to start coding without needing to learn complex syntax right away.

As we explore programming languages, youâ€™ll learn how to communicate your ideas to a computer in a language it can understand, allowing you to build your own programs and games.
