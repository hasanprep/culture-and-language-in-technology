# Opener

In this activity, you will learn how to use coordinates by observing points on a plot. Coordinates help us describe the exact location of a point on a grid by using two numbers: one for the horizontal position (x-axis) and one for the vertical position (y-axis).

## Instructions

1.	**Observe the Plot**

Look at the plot provided. You will see several points labeled A through P.

2.	**Determine the Coordinates of Each Point**

Your task is to determine the coordinates of each point. Each coordinate is written in the form $(x, y)$, where the first number represents the x-coordinate and the second number represents the y-coordinate.
Example: If point A is 3 spaces to the right on the x-axis and 2 spaces up on the y-axis, its coordinates would be (3, 2).

3.	**Write the Coordinates**

Work carefully to write down the coordinates of each point (A-P). 

4. **Pair and Share**

After you finish, compare your answers with a partner.
