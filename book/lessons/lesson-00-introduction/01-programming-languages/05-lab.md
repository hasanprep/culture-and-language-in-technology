# Lab: Exploring the Use of Programming Languages

Objective:

In this research lab, you will investigate how different programming languages are used in real-world applications. You will explore various industries and projects to understand how programming languages play a critical role in creating software, websites, games, and other technologies.

Instructions:

	1.	Choose a Programming Language
Select one programming language to focus your research on. You might choose a well-known language such as Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, or Swift.
	2.	Research Questions
Use the following questions to guide your research:
	•	What are the main uses of this programming language?
	•	Which industries or fields use this language (e.g., web development, mobile apps, data analysis, game development)?
	•	What are some well-known programs or systems created with this language?
	•	How does this language compare to others in terms of ease of use and functionality?
	3.	Research Sources
Use reliable sources, such as educational websites, online articles, and programming forums. Be sure to gather diverse perspectives on how the language is used across different fields.
	4.	Present Your Findings
After completing your research, prepare a short presentation or a written report. Be ready to share:
	•	A brief overview of the programming language you researched.
	•	Examples of real-world projects or applications that use this language.
	•	Insights into why certain industries prefer this language over others.

Reflection:

By the end of this lab, you will have a deeper understanding of how programming languages are applied in different industries and the unique features that make each language suitable for specific tasks.
