# The MakeCode Environment

n this section, we will take a deeper dive into MakeCode Arcade, a powerful tool designed to help you learn how to code by creating fun and interactive games. MakeCode Arcade is not just for game development—it’s a platform used worldwide to educate beginners and experienced coders alike, introducing fundamental programming concepts in a simple and engaging way.

MakeCode Arcade provides a hands-on approach to learning, allowing you to create games by either using block-based programming or transitioning to more advanced languages like JavaScript and Python as you progress. This flexibility makes it a valuable tool for learners at any level.

One of the great strengths of MakeCode Arcade is that it supports a wide variety of handheld game consoles. This gives you the opportunity to see your games in action in your hand.
