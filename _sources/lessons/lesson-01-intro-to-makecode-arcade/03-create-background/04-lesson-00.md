# Lesson: A Custom Color Palette

## Introduction

In this lesson, you will explore how to customize the color palette in MakeCode Arcade to create a more accurate representation of the Sonoran Desert. The standard color options in MakeCode may not fully capture the unique hues found in the desert landscape, such as the soft browns of the sand, the greens of cacti, or the deep blue sky. By adjusting the colors in the palette, you will learn how to use color in programming to create more realistic environments, while also gaining a deeper understanding of how colors can enhance the visual elements of your game or project. This activity will help you improve your design skills and make your game visually reflect the beautiful surroundings of the Sonoran Desert.

## Representing Colors in Computer Science

In computer science, colors are represented using numerical values, most commonly in formats like **RGB (Red, Green, Blue)**. In this system, each color is defined by a combination of red, green, and blue values, ranging from 0 to 255. By adjusting the intensity of each color component, computers can display millions of different colors. Another standard format is **hexadecimal (hex)**, which uses a six-digit code to represent colors, with two digits each for red, green, and blue. These numerical representations allow computers to reproduce colors across different screens and applications precisely. 

In this lesson, we will represent colors using hex color codes. The RCB color system will be introduced in a later section.

### The Hex Color Code System

Hex color codes are a way of representing colors in computer science using a six-digit code. The code is written with a “#” symbol followed by six characters, which are a combination of numbers (0-9) and letters (A-F). Each pair of characters represents the color's intensity of red, green, and blue (RGB). For example, the hex code “#FF5733” means the red component is set to the maximum value (FF), while green (57) and blue (33) are lower. This system allows for precise color selection and is widely used in web development and digital design. This color (#FF5733) is displayed below:

<form action="/action_page.php">
  <label for="favcolor">Select a color. Toggle the dropdown menu to view the color in HEX:<br></label><br>
  <input type="color" id="favcolor" name="favcolor" value="#72489c">
</form>
