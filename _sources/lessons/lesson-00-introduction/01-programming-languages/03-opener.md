# Opener

n this activity, you will work with a partner to explore different examples of code written in various programming languages. You may not know what the code does yet, but that’s okay! Your job is to look at each example and try to figure out what the code is doing based on patterns or similarities between them.

## Instructions

In this activity, you will work with a partner to explore different examples of code written in various programming languages. You may not know what the code does yet, but that’s okay! Your job is to look at each example and try to figure out what the code is doing based on patterns or similarities between them.


## Instructions

1. **Observe the Code**

Four different blocks of code are displayed below. Each block is written in a different programming language. Observe the code below in pairs:

```python
print('S-ke:g taṣ!')
```

```javascript
console.log("S-ke:g taṣ!");
```

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("S-ke:g taṣ!");
    }
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "S-ke:g taṣ!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

2. **Discuss with Your Partner**

Discuss the following with your partner:

- What do you think the code examples are doing?
- Can you spot any similarities between the examples?
- Do any parts of the code seem familiar, even if you don’t know the language?
- Why do you think there are differences in how the same task is written in different languages?


3. **Share with the Class**

After discussing with your partner, be ready to share your guesses and observations with the class!
