## Objective

In this lab, you will work in pairs to create a clear and detailed algorithm for making popovers (Indian fried bread). Your algorithm should include every step needed to complete the recipe, from start to finish, in the correct order.

## Procedure

### 1. Form Pairs

Work with a partner to complete the task. Each pair will write their algorithm together.

### 2. Understand the Task

Think about what it takes to make popovers (Indian fried bread). Consider all the necessary ingredients, tools, and actions.

### 3. Write Your Algorithm

Write a step-by-step algorithm that someone else could follow to make the bread. Be as specific as possible.
Consider the following:

- What do you need to do first?
- What equipment do you need?
- What ingredients must be prepared?
- How should each step be performed, and in what order?
- Include specific details like cooking time and temperature (if necessary).
  
### 4. Check for Clarity

Make sure your algorithm is clear and complete. Someone who has never made popovers should be able to follow your steps and make the bread correctly.

### 5. Share Your Algorithm

Once your algorithm is finished, you and your partner will share it with another pair to review. Check each other’s algorithms to see if they make sense and include all the steps.

## Questions for Review:

After completing your algorithm, answer the following questions with your partner:

1. Were there any steps you missed at first and had to add later?
2. Why is it important that your steps are clear and in the correct order?
3. How does your algorithm for making popovers relate to how computers use algorithms to complete tasks?

## Discussion

After completing your algorithm and reviewing it with your partner, discuss the following as a group:

1. **Missing Steps**: Did you miss any steps when you first wrote your algorithm? How did you realize you missed them, and why were they important?
2. **Importance of Order**: Why is it essential to follow steps in the correct order? Can you think of any steps that would cause problems if they were done out of order?
3. **Real-World Applications**: How does creating an algorithm for making popovers compare to how computers use algorithms? Can you think of a situation where a computer might “break” if it doesn’t follow the steps of an algorithm correctly?
