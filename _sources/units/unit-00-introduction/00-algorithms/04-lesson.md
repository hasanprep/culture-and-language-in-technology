# Lesson: Algorithms

Now that you’ve thought about the steps you follow in everyday tasks, let’s explore what those steps are called in computer science: algorithms. An algorithm is a set of instructions for completing a task or solving a problem. Just like you wrote out the steps for brushing your teeth or making a sandwich, computers follow algorithms to carry out tasks.

A computer needs an algorithm because it cannot think or make decisions on its own. It relies entirely on a set of precise, step-by-step instructions to perform tasks. These instructions, or algorithms, tell the computer exactly what to do and in what order, ensuring that the task is completed accurately and efficiently. Unlike computers, people do not always need algorithms because we can think critically, adapt to unexpected changes, and make decisions based on past experiences or intuition. For example, if we forget an ingredient while cooking, we can adjust on the spot, whereas a computer must follow its algorithm strictly without deviation. This flexibility in human thinking allows us to handle tasks more fluidly, while computers depend on algorithms to ensure they function correctly and consistently.

## Video

Watch the video below that shows how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich using an algorithm. Pay attention to the steps and how they must be done in the right order to get the result.

## Discussion Questions

Now that we’ve seen how the steps in the video work like an algorithm, let’s think about what you observed.

1. What were the key steps in making the peanut butter and jelly sandwich?
2. Why do you think the order of the steps is important?
3. What would happen if one of the steps was left out or done incorrectly?
4. How is making a sandwich like an algorithm?
5. Can you think of other examples where following a specific order of steps is important?
