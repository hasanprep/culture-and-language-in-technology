# Creating Sprites

In this section, you will explore how to create visual designs for your game by using the image editor in MakeCode Arcade. The image editor allows you to create custom characters and objects that can be part of your game’s world. Today, you will get creative by making a self-portrait sprite, a personalized design that will represent you in the game. This is your chance to express yourself visually while learning the basics of game design.

## What is a Sprite?

A **sprite** is a graphic or image that represents characters, objects, or elements in a game. Sprites are typically movable and can interact with other elements in the game, such as obstacles or enemies. They are an essential part of game development, allowing developers to bring visual elements into the game’s environment. By designing your own sprite, you can create custom characters and objects that will appear and move around in your game world.
