# Opener

In this exercise, you will create **pixel art** that represents something meaningful to the Tohono O’odham people, using a 10x10 grid. Pixel art is a form of digital art where images are created by coloring individual squares, or pixels, on a grid, similar to how sprites are designed in MakeCode Arcade. an example of pixel art is displayed below:

## Instructions

### 1. Design Your Pixel Art

Use the 10x10 grid provided to create a simple image that reflects an element of Tohono O’odham culture. This could be a symbol, object, or pattern that is important to the community. You will use colored pencils to fill in the squares on the grid, one square per color.

### 2. Share with the Class

Once you’ve completed your design, share your pixel art with the class. Be ready to explain what your design represents and why you chose it.

### 3. Discussion

After sharing, reflect on some of the challenges you faced while creating your pixel art. Was it difficult to fit your design into the small 10x10 grid? Did you need to simplify any details? This will help you understand how pixel art works and how it relates to creating sprites in MakeCode Arcade.
