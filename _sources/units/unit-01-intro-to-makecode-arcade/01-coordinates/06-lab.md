# Lab: Plotting a Ha:ṣañ with MakeCode Arcade

## Introduction

TODO

```{note}
This lab contains a complete example for reference only. Do not use this as your submission. Each ha:ṣañ should be unique.
```

## Objectives

> - 

## Materials

> - 1 PC or laptop
> - 1 ELECFREAKS Retro Arcade
> - 1 USB-C cable
> - 1 MakeCode Arcade Screen Grid
> - 1 Sheet of paper
> - 1 Pencil

## Procedure

### 1. Gather All Materials

TODO

### 2. Plan Your  Plot of a Ha:ṣañ

```{important}
The following example illustrates the process. **You must plan your own ha:ṣañ**.

### 3. Write Your Ha:ṣañ Plot Algorithm

```{important}
The following example illustrates the process. **You must write your own algorithm**.
```

1. Draw line from (85, 25) to (75, 25)
2. Draw line from (75, 25) to (75, 50)
3. Draw line from (75, 50) to (65, 50)
4. Draw line from (65, 50) to (65, 40)
5. Draw line from (65, 40) to (55, 40)
6. Draw line from (55, 40) to (55, 60)
7. Draw line from (55, 60) to (75, 60)
8. Draw line from (75, 60) to (75, 90)
9. Draw line from (75, 90) to (85, 90)
10. Draw line from (85, 90) to (85, 70)
11. Draw line from (85, 70) to (105, 70)
12. Draw line from (105, 70) to (105, 50)
13. Draw line from (105, 50) to (95, 50)
14. Draw line from (95, 50) to (95, 60)
15. Draw line from (95, 60) to (85, 80)
16. Draw line from (85, 60) to (85, 25)

### 4. Write the Code for Your Ha:ṣañ Plot

```{important}
The following example is just an example to illustrate the process. **You must write your own code**.
